        <h1>Gold quick summary:</h1>
        <p>We have yet to run a formal gold project, so this is very much an idea rather than a plan.  Any volunteers are very welcome. Here are some things to think about when approaching a gold project:

            <ul>
                <li>This is rocket project, concentrate on flying</li>
                <li>As each project is different, so you may complete more than one Gold award </li>
                <li>Prepare a plan we can have a look at</li>
                <li>Expect this to be weeks of work</li>
            </ul>
        <p>We have a template for a Gold project for anyone who is interested. </p>
        <p>The hope for Gold projects is that flyers will learn new skills and apply them while being able to access guidance and knowledge from more experienced rocket flyers. </p>
