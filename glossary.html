        <td>As part of the silver assessment:
            <br>The Silver MAP award requires a formal question and answer session between the flyer and the assessor. 
            This is described in detail in the Silver Guide document.</td>

        <td>Full Kit Rocket</td>
        <td>As part of the silver assessment:
            <br>The silver award is makes a distinction between almost assembled, 
            basic kits and a model rocket kit that has a significant number of steps
             to build.  Many rockets described as â€œbeginnerâ€ are suitable
              for Silver Map but please avoid kits that are very simple, 
              typically described as ready to fly or almost ready to fly.  
              The ability to assemble a kit is one of the things that this 
              award will assess.</td>
        </tr>
        <td>Discretionary Credit</td>
        <td>As part of the silver assessment:
            <br>An assessor may choose to consider â€œover deliveryâ€ in one area or 
            task as compensation for a shortfall in another.  The key to the silver 
            award is the need for the flyer to demonstrate understanding and skill, 
            not to process a task list. This is of particular relevance to the Q&A 
            task. It can also be applied to the flight tasks as well, take 
            particular note in the scratch build elective.</td>
        </tr>
        <td>Scratch Built:</td>
        <td>A rocket built mainly or exclusively from materials not from a rocket kit.  This may
            include parts manufactured for model rockets, such as nose cones and body tube.
