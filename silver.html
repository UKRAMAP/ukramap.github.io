            <h1>Welcome to MAP Silver</h1>
            <p>I hope you will find interesting and helpful.

            <p>
                The MAP silver award exists to provide a novice rocket flyer with a slightly more challenging set of tasks 
                that are unlikely to be completed in a single day.
                There are three core tasks and three electives (you get to choose from a list.) Your progress should be
                recorded on a separate downloadable record sheet, called MAPSAN.
                This is the second step of the MAP scheme. UKRA expects that the flyer does most of the work but
                 we appreciate difficulties where the flyer is a younger child.
                There is much more informaton in the downloadable docs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>IMPORTANT:</b> There are requirements for supervision within some safety codes and guidance especially as it relates to pyrotechnic motors. Those standards, and anything related to safety, always
                take precedence over MAP.

                <h1>Silver quick summary:</h1>
        
                There are three steps, summarised here with details in downloadable documents. The downloaded documents are rather formal in the language they use, this is just to be as clear as possible. Please talk to us if any of this is confusing.
                <br>
                The first task is to perform the core tasks, secondly choose and perform three electives from a list.  Finally there will be a short formal conversation about the rockets flown to demonstrating your level of understanding.
        
                <h3>Core</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fly a model Rocket on an A motor </li>
                    <li>Fly the same or another rocket on a C motor </li>
                    <li>Fly a different rocket than used above with a different recovery system to the first two flights</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Electives</h3>
                Choose any three of the following: You may fly these on the same or different days as required.
                <ul>
                    <li>E1 </li>
                    <li>E2 </li>
                    <li>E3 </li>
                    <li>E4 </li>
                    <li>E5 </li>
                    <li>E6 </li>
