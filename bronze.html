            <h1>Welcome to MAP Bronze</h1>
            <p>I hope you will find interesting and helpful.
                Please let us know what you think.</p>

            <p>
                The MAP bronze award exists to provide a novice rocket flyer with a set of relatively simple challenges
                that could be completed in a single day if you wish.
                There are two core tasks and one elective (you get to choose from a list.) Your progress should be
                recorded on a separate downloadable record sheet, called MAPBAN.
                This is the very beginning of the MAP scheme. UKRA hope that the flyer does most of the work but
                receives some help in particular, where the flyer is a younger child.
                There is more informaton in the downloadable docs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>IMPORTANT:</b> There are requirements for adult supervision within some safety codes and guidance
                especially as it relates to pyrotechnic motors. Those standards, and anything related to safety, always
                take precedence over MAP.

        <h1>Bronze quick summary:</h1>

        There are three steps, summarised here with details in downloadable documents, press "get the docs" above for these. The downloaded documents are
        rather formal in the language they use, this is just to be as clear as possible. Please talk to us if any of this is confusing.
        <p>There are three tasks every Bronze flyer needs to do, called core tasks. and then a fourth that you get to choose one from a list, this is called the elective. </p>

        <h3>Core</h3>
        You need to do these all on the same day:
        <ul>
            <li>Fly a model Rocket </li>
            <li>Fly it again </li>
            <li>Have a chat about your rocket </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Electives</h3>
        Choose one of the following: we prefer this on the same day as the core tasks, but whenever you can is OK.
        <ul>
            <li>Fly the same rocket again, using a more powerful motor </li>
            <li>Exchange/swap the recovery system on the rocket, see docs for details </li>
            <li>Construction elective (the wet weather option) </li>
        </ul>
