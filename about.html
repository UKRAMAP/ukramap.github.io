        <p class="about-title">About the author.</p>
        Hi, I am Michael Williams long time UK rocket flyer and one of the United Kingdom Rocketry Association founder members. You can get hold of me on the UKRA MAP Email address.
        
        <p class="about-title">About this site.</p>
        This site is hosted on github pages, in the hope of making updates and contribution easy for the technically minded while keeping the cost as low.
        This site also undergoes limited testing, mainly using the current releases of Chrome and Firefox.  
        If you are using Android browser, Safari or Edge and getting problems with this site please try the latest version of Google Chrome
        
        <p class="about-title">How to contibute</p>
        There are some things we could really do with some help with, especially artwork of various sorts.  I'm also pretty sure you can see that these pages were put together 
        by somebody who knows more about model rocketry than he does about web design.
